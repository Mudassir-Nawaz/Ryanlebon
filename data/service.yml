    - title: Modern Governance
      icon: tf-ion-pull-request
      details: Most organizations focus on improving software delivery by optimizing for increased developer productivity and operational efficiency. However, this approach often leaves security and compliance behind due to the accelerated pace and ephemeral nature of cloud resources. To overcome this false choice between exposing the organization to risk or slowing down development, modern governance provides continuously audited and verified policies. By implementing modern governance, organizations can go faster and safer without compromising security and compliance.

      details: Infrastructure, Platform, Software... as a Service? Cloud is defined by self-service access to resources, but many organizations struggle to develop platforms fit for their purpose.

Bring all the interests together and build with the collective for the collective.
